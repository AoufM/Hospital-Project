##Main things to be completed--
1. I have to connect all the pages to each other
2. The inside of Cart functionality works but when the order is placed I have to collect that info in the database same goes with the doctors as well
3. The Navbar is not functional. I have to make the links works
4. The buttons like book now and buy now shpuld work in doctorCard page and MedicineCard pages.
5. Also when the user clicks on the buy now button only that product should be added in  the cart right now the every product is in the cart.
6. After logging in the user should be directed to the main page which is the doctorCard page


##What is where-- 
1. The CArt system includes the files:- Cart.jsx, Cart.css,ContextCart.jsx, Items.jsx,Products.jsx, Reducer.jsx
2. For the backend there is only one file that is Firebase.jsx
3. The doctor pages include doctorCard.jsx and DoctorCArd.css this will be the main page of the website
4. The medicine pages include medicineCard.jsx and medicineCard.css
5. The login and sgnup codes is in the homepage.jsx and inside the LoginForm.jsx and the SignupForm.jsx wjicj is inside the Forms folder
6. Every Form is stored inside the Forms folder
7. The admin part is in the Admin Part folder


##Lastly when all this is done I need to adjust css and make website responsive
